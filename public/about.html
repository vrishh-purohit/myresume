<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi,my name is Vrishti Purohit. I am a BMM graduate, I live in Mumbai. I like to design and starting to like coding now.
My motto is to make things look fancy and colourful, which automatically makes it exciting.
</p>

<p>I have my own ways to look for inspirations might be on Pinterest, Dribbble, Behance or
  even in clouds or some weird trees. I like to spend my free time watching Youtube videos, crafting,
listening to music.</p>
